# Squarespace.com

Upon my first interaction, I found “Squarespace” website to be a user-friendly platform which incorporates the mental modal well within its design by assigning the key features at expected fields making it intuitive. Upon studying the website, the following are my key takeaways:

### Usability and Accessibility:

Generally, I found Squarespace to be perceivable, operable, understandable; however, I did not find the site to be robust as it lacks the following.

  - Technologies like *text-to-speech*, *voice command*, *Screen reader*, *Head pointer* and *Motion tracking/eye tracking*.
  - Accessibility of site is limited to only *English-speaking* users as translation is unavailable.

Content on the website is readable as it follows the contrast background concept well. They made it obvious what’s clickable by styling differently; however, the clickable buttons can be made more visible by using more brighter color on hover.

### Web conventions: 

Squarespace follows the following web conventions.

  1. **Logo placement:** 

    - Logo is placed on the left side of the page.
    - It is placed highest upon the page across the platform.
    - Logo is always linked to home page.

  2. **Main Navigation:**

    - Navigation is made easy to user by placing the main navigation on top of the page.
    - By restricting the main menu to 3 pages, they are simplifying the user experience from being overwhelmed with content and helping them navigate for more easily.

  3. **Content Hierarchy and Colors:**

  Squarespace maintained content hierarchy by applying appropriate heading and content styles. This enables the user to find the appropriate information more easily.
  Color scheme is effective in Squarespace as it utilizes only 2-4 colors across the website thereby maintaining cohesiveness and a systemic flow for the user.

  4. **Grid:**

  Squarespace used grid system to organize and arrange content and images, to achieve consistency, to create flow and hierarchy on the pages.

  5. **Link styling and Buttons:**

  Squarespace styles their links uniquely by adding underline wherever necessary and applying hover effects so that they can be differentiated from normal text.

  They used appropriate color scheme for buttons; however, background and hover effect are poorly styled. I would apply darker color on hover to make it significantly visible.

### Visual Hierarchy:

In terms of its visual hierarchy, square has good *size and scale* which provides focus to the user to access appropriate information and adopts the depth of field which makes text readable and differentiate the information.

Squarespace utilized only 4 colors and *color contrast* throughout the website; however, I would use a darker contrast color on hover to make it easy for the user to know when their cursor is on the button.

The website has good *typography and proximity* which makes everything relatable. They have content related to images and image captions wherever required.

The website lacks *negative spacing* in multiple areas. There is content overlap on pictures on “Explore how customers use our platform” section on main page which can be viewed [here](https://www.squarespace.com/). There is also a content overlap on “GET STARTED” page which can be viewed [here](https://www.squarespace.com/templates).

The text on website flows naturally as they followed *left-right alignment* and followed *rule of odds* by utilizing 3 cards wherever applicable which makes it more visually appealing. The platform is also made more cohesive by applying repetitive color schemes and consistent layouts across various web pages.

### Mobile Friendliness:

Squarespace is a mobile friendly responsive website. The following are the takeaways in terms of its responsiveness.

  1.	I would make it consistent by keeping the name of the website along with the icon throughout all the resolutions.
  2.	Some of the content in mobile version are misaligned. For example, I would align the images in the slider to center to make it more appealing in “see how it works” section.

Site has maintained a proper content flow by effectively utilizing cards in appropriate sections.

### Conclusion:

>Squarespace is a mobile friendly website which allows the user to access the information easily by maintaining good **web conventions** and **visual hierarchies**. The design is enhanced by **strong “system model” and strong “interaction model”**. However; the user experience can be further improved by effective utilization of *negative spacing* in some of the sections and *color contrast* in styling buttons.
